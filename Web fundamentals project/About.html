                <br>
                <p class="subText2">The rise of fast fashion has caused the habit of throwing out clothes before they have been completely maximised to become increasingly common. The accumulated waste brings about devastating levels of pollution.</p>
                <p class="subText2">FashionFarm is a sustainable fashion charity event conducted by Sunway International Business Society (SIBS). The event includes a collection drive for pre-loved clothes on the 9th to 13th of May in the Sunway College Foyer Booth while the main event will be held on the 8th and 9th of June in Sunway University Art Gallery.</p>
                <p class="subText2">Besides aiming to advocating for sustainable fashion,  the purpose of Fashionfarm is  to promote awareness of climate change and inspire ventures into sustainable entrepreneurship among the Sunway student community. 10% of net profit will be donated to those in need through Sunway Student Volunteers (SSV).</p>

<h3 class="missionTxt">OUR MISSION</h3>
<p>We are here to <b>raise awareness</b> of the <b>environmental</b> and <b>economic</b> issues caused by the fashion industry in Asia.</p>

<br><br>
<p class="subtitle center greenText">HOW WE STARTED</p>
<div class="content text">
<img src="Media/Logo.PNG" width="200px" class="center">
<P>Since 2020, Fashion Farm has worked with more than 100 apparel businesses and entrepreneurs, participated in over 250 events, collaborated with academics, NGOs and various industry stakeholders, and received tens of thousands of media impressions. We look forward to continuing in this way, working to advance sustainability within the entire fashion system – industry AND consumers.  </P>
<p>Our annual Fashion Farm Week which began in 2020, became a monthly webinar series in 2021, and for 2022 we will be presenting a hybrid conference model.</p>
<p>In September 2021 we launched the 5R's Practice in partnership with Baju Malaysia, in an effort to help Asian brands and retailers save time when researching the many resources and strategies that are available. These now live online in one centralized location that are easily divided by various categories. We will soon be adding additional benefits to the Toolkit that include customized lists, newsfeed and assessment and benchmarking tools. </p>
<p>It is no secret that the fashion industry is facing many challenges, including but not limited to: the use of pesticides and fertilizers to grow cotton; the highly toxic chemicals used to process and treat fabric; sweatshops and unfair labour practices; enormous amounts of water required to make clothing; the unethical disposal of contaminated water; and the fast fashion frenzy that is contributing to the growing number of textiles that end up in landfill each year.</p>
<p>We realize that perfection doesn’t exist. There are still so many questions and not enough answers; and there are many ways for fashion businesses to become sustainable. Our goal is to present the industry with fair and accurate information, and to build capacity within the fashion system to make smart decisions and take action where possible. If we all make one small change in the right direction – a responsible direction – then collectively we believe it can have a positive social and environmental impact. </p>
<p>Our friends and partners – both local and global -are growing, and so we plan to have a dedicated page for them very soon that will describe in more detail how we support one another, partner or collaborate together in an effort to future-proof the fashion industry.  They include: Baju Circularity, LifeOnLine, SlowFash, REVOLUTION and Fabricity.</p>
