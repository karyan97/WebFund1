<br>
<p>The 5R’s of Fashion begin with <b>REDUCE</b>, the first and by far most important rule! Global fashion consumption is so out of control that in order to meet consumer demand, factories are pressured to churn out low-quality clothing instantaneously, creating unsafe working conditions and human rights violations.</p>
<p>So, what can we do to reduce our clothing consumption?</p>
<ol>
    <li>Choose practical items and wardrobe basics.</li>
    <li>Choose quality over quantity.</li>
    <li>Avoid impulse purchases while only buy what we truly need.</li>
    <li>Launder less.</li>
</ol>

<br>
<img src="Media/reuse.PNG" width="130" class="center">
<br>
<p>A great way to reduce our fashion consumption is to <b>REUSE</b>.</p>
<p>Did you know that textile waste is the fastest growing category of municipal solid waste, contributing to overflowing landfills and CO2 emissions that are released as our garments break down? The average person purchases 60% more clothing than 15 years ago and keeps those items half as long before discarding them. This is a result of low quality, cheap and accessible fast fashion and pressure to keep our wardrobes current. Reusing our clothes and extending their life can help mitigate this waste problem. Currently, only 60% of North Americans shop second hand once a year or less.</p>
<p>But, we don’t always have to purchase brand new items to satisfy our desire for new and trendy pieces. Clothing reuse can also include shopping at thrift, consignment and vintage stores, borrowing, swapping and lending clothes with friends and family or renting, repurposing and repairing your clothes.</p>
<p>So, how can we reuse what we already own? Whether a garment has lived a long and productive life, or has sat unused in the the back of a closet, it inevitably comes time to say goodbye. Many brands today have clothing take back programs (eg. Patagonia, Levi’s, H&M & more) but before you recycle or donate that garment, stop and think about how you might give it a second life. Upcycle it, give it to a friend, sell it — the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Start by looking in your closet and try to see each piece of clothing in a new light. Find your creative self by pairing something you haven’t worn in a while with a different accessory or item you’ve never paired it with before. If that doesn’t work, then think of alternative uses.</p>

<br>
<img src="Media/resale.PNG" width="130" class="center">
<br>
<p>Good news for a change: the <b>RESALE</b> and second hand clothing market is thriving and expected to surpass luxury retail by the year 2022. </p>
<p>While thrifting is certainly not a new concept, reasons for buying second hand have changed. Thrifting has traditionally been a way of shopping, well thrifty, but there has been a shift in behaviour in that the average thrifter used to be an economically minded consumer, while today, we have the informed consumer hoping to reduce the negative environmental impact of their purchases.</p>

<br>
<img src="Media/recycle.PNG" width="130" class="center">
<br>
<p>Many textiles can be <b>RECYCLED</b> — even your undies and holey socks. They can go in the donation bin along with household textiles and clean, dry garments, shoes and accessories. (In this context, “recycle” means the breaking down into raw materials, such as fibre or shreds, and being made into something else.)</p>
<ol>
    <li>More and more fashion brands, such as Zara, Mango and H&M, have take back programs in their stores. Bring in your unwanted clothes—even from other brands. (Often there is a discount given towards your next purchase, so use with your conscious-consumer radar on.)</li>
    <li>Look for garments and shoes made from recycled textiles and ocean plastic waste when you shop. Levis, H&M, Matt & Nat, G-Star Raw and Adidas all have recycled content options.</li>
    <li>When shopping, be conscious of packaging and hang-tags that are recycled or recyclable. Better yet, refuse to purchase garments that are over-packaged and definitely refuse a bag with your purchase, as most cannot easily be recycled.</li>
</ol>

<br>
<img src="Media/repair.PNG" width="130" class="center">
<br>
<p>Damaged clothing can and should be donated for repurpose or recycling, but <b>REPAIRING</b> our clothes is often an even better alternative to the textile bin. The longer we can extend the life of our wearable garments, the more we reduce our environmental impacts. Sometimes, a simple DIY repair is all it takes.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Learn to sew a button on by hand, fix a fallen hem, or patch a rip in your pants. Watch a tutorial online, or take a course at a community sewing hub to learn your way around a sewing machine.</li>
    <li>Why hide your repairs? Take up visible mending; it’s a way to turn holes in sweaters and rips in pants into beautiful and colourful stitching embellishments. Not your speed? Sew a premade embroidery patch over it. You can even design your own!</li>
    <li>If your shoes are leather, or your garment needs professional help, cobblers and tailors can be your wardrobe’s new best friend.</li>
