    <h4>As conscious shoppers, the best way to reduce your carbon footprint is to go preloved. But if you're looking for something new, there are plenty of local brands that are putting in the effort to tackle the complex issues of the industry across different areas. Whether it is less waste, environmentally low-impact materials or community-minded practices, the easiest way to shop consciously is to think about what the most important thing is to you––instead of trying to find the perfect company that's accounting for everything.</h4>

    <p>Below, we've rounded up our latest pick of local fashion brands who are innovating towards a better, greener planet:</p>

    <h3>1. <a href="https://wustler.co/">Wustler ></a></h3> 
    <img src="Media/Pic11.jpg" width="80%" class="center"> 
    <p>Wustler's elegant sleepwear and loungewear pieces are crafted from viscose, a semi-synthetic fabric made from regenerated cellulose fibre regarded as a sustainable alternative to polyester and nylon due to the waste-minimising Lyocell manufacturing process. It also uses non-toxic and environmental-friendly fabric dyes. </p>
    <p>Additionally, one per cent of total sales is donated to non-profit Women's Earth Alliance (WEA) annually. WEA empowers women with the skills and tools they need to protect our Earth and has trained over 5,000 women leaders.</p>

    <p></p>
    <h3>2. <a href="https://www.lttl.co/">LTTL ></a></h3> 
    <img src="Media/Pic12.jpg" width="80%" class="center">
    <p>LTTL focuses on zero waste from the get-go: each garment is designed using innovative pattern-cutting techniques that reduces the amount of fabric waste, while leftover spaces can be a functional item for the finished piece, like belts and straps. This line shows how each piece drapes on different bodies differently, as it is all cut from the same size of cloth, and with the same dimensions. </p>
    
    <p></p>
    <h3>3. <a href="https://bijibiji.co/">Biji Biji Ethical Fashion ></a></h3> 
    <img src="Media/Pic13.jpg" width="80%" class="center">
    <p>Their signature products are bags and accessories made from new seat belts that didn't make the quality control cut in factories, rendering them unusable in the car manufacturing industry. Instead of going to the landfill, Biji Biji Ethical Fashion upcycles these seat belts and transform to functional pieces of fashion. Aside from seat belt webbings, they also upcycle discarded tarpaulin banners and needle punch carpets (single use carpets found at events and exhibitions). But our favourite material has to be the luxury line of colourful vintage kimonos recut in purses and pouches.</p>

    <p></p>
    <h3>4. <a href="https://www.kanoewear.com/">Kanoe ></a></h3> 
    <img src="Media/Pic14.jpg" width="80%" class="center">
    <p>Founded by Noelle Kan who has experience in social work, Kanoe promises to be ethical, sustainable and to use fabrics that are woven from only natural fibres. They design all their garments in-house and are proud to say they run on a small yet mighty team. Kanoe sources their fabrics from all over the world, and work with local business and artisans to create one-of-a-kind creations. Our favourite collection thus far, the kimonos made out of vintage tea towels from Europe!</p>
