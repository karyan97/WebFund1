    <p>Noelle Kan lovingly describes her fashion label KANOE as “a child of the tropics who is a wonder lover and a collector of beauty from all over the place so she can wear it here in the urban tropical heat”.</p>
    <p>KANOE is really like her own child, birthed out of her own journey.</p>
    <p>Noelle recalled being in different cultures, living among different environments of beauty and design, and discovering who she is and what she really loves, as the basis for the brand.</p>
    <p>Her vision is to provide a better living through sustainable wear that KANOE promotes.</p>
    <h2>Even as a child, Noelle harboured an interest in fashion, dreaming of being a fashion designer.</h2> 
    <p>She would try to copy the design patterns from the books and even tried to draw figures by herself from a fashion illustration book she bought.</p>
    <p>When it was time for her to choose her university, <b>one particular course made her heart beat a little faster</b>: fashion design.</p>
    <blockquote>“If I could do anything I wanted to do, I would study fashion design. I remember telling my father this, and he said no. I did not take that answer too well.”</blockquote>
    <p>The next option was for her was humanitarian work; her father suggested pharmacy.</p>
    <p>They found a middle ground with a Bachelor’s of Arts and Science in Adelaide, but dreams don’t die so easily.</p>
    <p>“I was still persistent in my desire to do fashion, because art was something I was naturally gifted in. I found it such a waste if I did not see what I could do with this natural talent the Creator himself had lovingly bestowed unto me.”</p>

    <br>

    <p>Taking matters in her own hands, she bought a sewing machine and attempted to sew her own designs.</p>
    <p>When calling home to her parents, now and then she would question what she was doing and express how much she wanted to study fashion.</p>

    <h2>Unsure of what to do next, she considered working with a church or teaching, but had no idea she’d be diving into the fashion industry.</h2>
    <p>“I went for a marketplace talk because Hannah Yeoh was speaking at it, and she was talking about the importance of a good name and branding.”
    <p>But even then, design or fashion wasn’t on her mind.</p>
    <p>That changed when a pastor prayed for her, and said, “Noelle, you have buried your talents too deep. It’s time for you to use them Lay off the expectations of others on you, and do what you were created to do.”</p>
    <p>Having a pastor encourage her fashion dreams instead of supporting her going into church or social work was the rebirth of her fashion path.</p>
    <p>So on October 31 2016, Noelle launched KANOE with a capital of only RM5,000, which came from her parents.</p>

    <h2>“Giving birth to KANOE and deciding to study fashion is one of the best decisions I’ve ever made in life.”</h2>
    <p>Besides meeting new people, she also enjoys being part of a community of women she met in various bazaars and pop-up event, who all have started their own businesses.</p>
    <p>In fact, one moment in her journey that stood out to Noelle was when speaking to a girl she met at a popup event. “She told me how much she loved my designs and how she was going to study fashion!”</p> 
    <p>Noelle is very grateful for everything her business has experienced so far in its one year of existence, and is now looking to the future.</p>
    <blockquote>“I am enjoying learning so much while on this journey, and definitely thankful for the ladies out there who love KANOE. I would love to see KANOE expand to many places, having girls all over the world wear Kanoe… that it would be a name for the wonder lovers out there.”</blockquote>
